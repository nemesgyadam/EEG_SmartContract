# Secure Storage and Access Control for Personal and EEG Data using Blockchain

## Abstract
This paper introduces a blockchain-based solution for the secure and efficient management of personal and EEG (Electroencephalogram) data for research subjects. By separating and interlinking data to ensure privacy and integrity, and implementing role-based access controls through a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, our approach significantly enhances traditional information security methodologies. Incorporating the principles of operational excellence, our method offers a comprehensive understanding and functionality of data management, making it secure, efficient, and user-friendly. It aims to draw stakeholders closer to essential professional practices while upholding the core values of privacy and integrity.

## Features
- **Blockchain-Based Security**: Leverages the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain for data integrity and security.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Utilizes Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to enforce strict access controls based on user roles.
- **Privacy and Integrity**: Ensures the privacy of personal and EEG data while maintaining data integrity through advanced cryptographic techniques.
- **Operational Excellence**: Integrates principles of operational excellence to improve upon traditional information security methodologies.
